1:  "the most insistent question facing any theorist of capitalism is the question of how to incorporate finance."

1:  For Marxists, the economic collapse of 2008 "has been to see it as a collapse of fictitious capital, a return to the real economy ... settling of accounts and reemergence of contradictions that have existed since the 70s."

2:  For Marazzi, "The rise of financial value is premised upon the extension of value production beyond the factory and into everyday life. This includes, first, the 'coproduction' of value by the consumer who becomes a part of the production process (e.g. in IKEA, where the consumer finds the product, moves the product, and builds the product); and second, the valorization of free labour, whereby the productive labour of individuals online (creating social networks, ranking pages, etc.) is employed within productive circuits."

2:  "Finance has come to dominate the economy first, on a personal level with the emergence of technologies like credit cards and the rise of personal indebtedness."

2:  "Second, finance has reshaped the economy at the level of the first with the creation and newfound dominance of the Chief Financial Officer position."

3:  "Third, financialization has occurred at the national level through ... the political capture of the state by the ideology of finance."

3:  "Finally and most obviously, finance has altered the economy at the global level with the tremendous size and power of the financial markets now dwarfing the rest of the world economy."

3:  "Accumulation of finance capital cannot be thought through the lens of the labour theory of value, which sees finance as at best a redistribution of existing capital."

4:  "capitalization as the measure of accumulation therefore provides us with three advantages: First, it is how practicing capitalists operate--and if we want to understand the dynamics of modern capitalism, we need to be a materialist in the proper Marxist sense. Second, it allows us to explain how capitalism can price everything--and this is not through the commodity-form, but rather through the capitalization-form. Finally, this thesis allows us to unify the various forms of capital, including financial, into a single measure."

4:  "The major question that needs to be raised now is *how* capital is accumulated in this way. Capitalization is the measure of accumulation, but it in itself says nothing about how it is augmented."

4:  "In centralizing the organization of an economic sector, today's monopolies have become non-state governance systems. ... they have the capacity to organize the production, distribution, marketing, and financing of an entire sector; they can dictate to suppliers what to make and for what price--a situation strikingly similar to the planned economics of communist countries."

5:  "modern capitalism is precisely a denial of free markets, a denial of deterritorialization and a denial of decentralized control. Accelerationism, in all its aspects, is opposed to this and thus opposed to neoliberalism."

6:  "Relative accelerationism, or accelerationism as a tactic, is a useful means to undermine the rigid territorialized nature of modern capitalism."

6:  "Absolute accelerationism, on the other hand, is the more radical and speculation vision ... accelerationism is not a means to provide human comforts, but instead an opportunity to expand the human beyond itself--a continual and potentially endless project of dissecting and reorganizing man in order to explore what lies beyond our finite instantiation."
